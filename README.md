# 🥗 NutriDAO: Own Your Nutrition Data. Shape the Future of Wellness.

## Overview

**NutriDAO** is a decentralized, user-owned data collective focused on the ethical contribution and activation of supplement usage data. As part of the DataChain Collection, NutriDAO empowers individuals and communities to reclaim sovereignty over their most valuable asset: data.

- **User-Owned Data Economies:** Individuals profit from their data contributions.
- **Community-Governed AI:** Algorithms serve collective interests, not corporate agendas.
- **Ethical Data Ecosystems:** Transparency replaces exploitation.

NutriDAO is built on **OpenFHIRChain**, bringing FHIR medical standards to the blockchain for privacy-preserving, interoperable health data sharing.

## Mission & Vision

- 🧠 Empower individuals to control their nutrition data
- 🔗 Enable interoperable, privacy-preserving health data sharing
- 🤖 Support human-aligned, AI-driven wellness tools
- 💡 Democratize access to high-quality health data insights

> In a world where $500B+ in annual data value flows to tech giants while data creators receive nothing, we're building a fairer alternative. Our solution: Tokenized Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) that transform passive data into active, reward-generating assets.

---

## How It Works

- **Contribute:** Users voluntarily contribute anonymized supplement usage data.
- **Pool:** Data is stored in a Data Liquidity Pool (DLP) via smart contracts, ensuring consent-based access and rewards.
- **Tokenize:** Contributions are tokenized, giving users ownership and a voice in governance.
- **Activate:** Data can be used to train AI models and power wellness applications—always under user consent.

---

## Roadmap

- **Bootcamp & Discovery:** Understanding Vana ecosystem, architecture, and consent-driven data models.
- **Building Phase:** Finalizing FHIR data subset, designing smart contracts, refining token and governance model.
- **GTM Sprint:** Launching MVP, defining tokenomics, preparing for adoption and integration.
- **Demo Day:** Presenting NutriDAO to investors, builders, and the Vana ecosystem.
