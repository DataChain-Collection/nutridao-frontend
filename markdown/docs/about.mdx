### 🌐 The DataChain Collection & NutriDAO

**DataChain Collection: Redefining Data Ownership**  
We're a pioneering organization building decentralized DataDAOs where communities reclaim sovereignty over their most valuable asset: data. Founded on the principle that data should serve people – not corporations – we combine blockchain technology and privacy-preserving AI to create:

- **User-Owned Data Economies**  
  Where individuals profit from their data contributions  
- **Community-Governed AI**  
  Where algorithms serve collective interests, not corporate agendas  
- **Ethical Data Ecosystems**  
  Where transparency replaces exploitation  

**Why We Exist**  
In a world where $500B+ in annual data value flows to tech giants while data creators receive nothing, we're building a fairer alternative. Our solution: Tokenized Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) that transform passive data into active, reward-generating assets.

1. 72% of supplement research uses biased commercial data  
2. Consumers receive 0% value from $1.2T wellness data market  
3. AI health tools lack diverse, ethically-sourced training data  

**Our Response:**  
As the first medical DataDAO in the DataChain Collection, NutriDAO pioneers:
